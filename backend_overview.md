## Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Management
- **Register** — Email + username + password. Password hashed with bcryptjs.
- **Login** — Validates credentials, creates a signed session in Redis, sets a signed `sid` cookie.
- **Google OAuth** — Login / register via Google ID token (`google-auth-library`).
- **OTP Verification** — Send and verify a one-time password for email verification or 2FA flows.
- **Logout** — Deletes the current device session from Redis.
- **Logout All Devices** — Deletes all sessions for a user from Redis using the `userIdIndex` FT search index.
- **Forgot Password** — Sends a reset OTP via Resend email service.
- **Change Password** — Authenticated users can change their existing password.
- **Set Password** — Allows users who signed up via Google (no password) to set one.

### 👤 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Three roles are defined in `config/roles.js`:

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `STUDENT` | Enroll in courses, access allowed lessons |
| `CREATOR` | All STUDENT abilities + create/manage their own courses, sections, lessons |
| `ADMIN` | Full access to everything including user management |

**Admin operations:**
- View all users (paginated)
- Check a specific user's session status
- Force-logout any user's session
- Block / Unblock users
- Change a user's role
- Permanently delete a user account

### 📚 LMS Content Management

#### Courses
- Full CRUD for courses.
- Courses have a `status` of `Draft` or `Published`.
- **Dedicated publish/unpublish endpoints** (`PATCH /course/:id/publish` and `PATCH /course/:id/unpublish`) separate status management from general course updates.
- **Publishing validations**: A course can only be published if it has ≥1 section, every section has ≥1 lesson, and every lesson has a video attached.
- The general update endpoint (`PATCH /course/:id`) cannot change `status` — it is excluded from the update schema.
- `GET /course/creator/me` supports `?status=Draft`, `?status=Published`, or `?status=All` to fetch all in a single call.
- All list endpoints support cursor-based pagination (`?cursor=<id>&limit=<n>`).
- Cascading delete: deleting a course also deletes all its sections, lessons, and associated media from B2.

#### Sections
- Scoped to a course. Ordered by `order` field.
- **Order validation**: Duplicate `order` values within the same course are rejected (`409 Conflict`) at both the controller level and the DB level (compound unique index on `{ course, order }`).
- Cascading delete: deleting a section also deletes all its lessons.

#### Lessons
- Scoped to a section (and course). Ordered by `order` field.
- **Order validation**: Duplicate `order` values within the same section are rejected (`409 Conflict`) at both the controller level and the DB level (compound unique index on `{ section, order }`).
- `isPreview` flag marks a lesson as accessible to any authenticated user without enrollment.

### 🎟️ Enrollment System
- Students can enroll in any `Published` course.
- **Business rules enforced:**
  - User must be authenticated.
  - Course must exist and be `Published` (not `Draft`).
  - The course creator cannot enroll in their own course.
  - A user can only enroll once (compound unique index on `{ user, course }`).
- Enrollment status: `Active` or `Completed`.

### 🔒 Lesson Access Control
Lesson access is determined by a strict middleware chain. The exact priority order is:

```
Is user authenticated?
    NO  → 401 Unauthorized
    YES ↓
Is user ADMIN?
    YES → Allow (full access)
    NO  ↓
Is user the course Creator?
    YES → Allow (full access)
    NO  ↓
Is the lesson marked isPreview?
    YES → Allow (any authenticated user)
    NO  ↓
Is user Enrolled (Active) in this course?
    YES → Allow
    NO  → 403 Forbidden
```

This logic applies to:
- `GET /lesson/:id` — via `checkLessonAccess` middleware.
- `GET /lesson/section/:sectionId` — inline access control in the controller, using `optionalAuthenticate` to handle both logged-in and logged-out users gracefully.

### 🖼️ Media Management
- **Media** is a standalone, reusable module that tracks uploaded-file metadata. It has no knowledge of lessons, courses, or sections — business models (Lesson) reference Media documents.
- **B2 key = `_id`**: Each Media document's `_id` (converted to string via `.toString()`) is used directly as the B2 object key. There is no separate `storageKey` field.
- **Upload flow**: Lesson-scoped. `POST /media/lesson/:lessonId/upload-url` creates a draft Media document and returns a presigned PUT URL. The frontend uploads directly to B2. After success, the frontend calls `POST /media/lesson/:lessonId/confirm` to verify and finalize.
- **Replace flow**: `POST /media/lesson/:lessonId/replace-url` deletes the existing video from B2, creates a new Media document, and returns a fresh presigned PUT URL.
- **Robust Verification**: When confirming, the backend queries B2/S3 using `HeadObjectCommand` to verify the file exists on the storage server and that its actual size matches the claimed size. If verification fails, the B2 object is cleaned up, the Media document is deleted, and a `400` error is returned.
- **Download flow**: Backend generates a presigned GET URL on-the-fly from `media._id.toString()`. The URL is never persisted in MongoDB.
- **Deletion**: Only the original uploader or an ADMIN may delete. Deletes the object from B2 (including all versions/markers) and removes the Media document.

### 📦 File Storage (Backblaze B2)
- Generate **pre-signed upload URLs** so clients upload directly to B2, not through the server.
- Generate **pre-signed download URLs** for secure, time-limited file access.
- Permanent deletion utility (`permanentlyDeleteMultipleFromB2`) handles versioned objects and delete markers.
- **Important**: All B2 keys passed to the delete utility must be **strings** (e.g., `_id.toString()`), not ObjectId objects.

### `Section`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | String | Required |
| `description` | String | Optional |
| `course` | ObjectId → Course | Required, indexed |
| `order` | Number | Required; unique within course |

### `Lesson`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | String | Required |
| `description` | String | Optional |
| `course` | ObjectId → Course | Required, indexed |
| `section` | ObjectId → Section | Required, indexed |
| `video` | ObjectId → Media | Required, references a Media document |
| `duration` | Number | Seconds, default `0` |
| `isPreview` | Boolean | Default `false` |
| `order` | Number | Required; unique within section |

### `Enrollment`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | ObjectId → User | Required, indexed |
| `course` | ObjectId → Course | Required, indexed |
| `status` | String | `Active` \| `Completed`, default `Active` |
| `enrolledAt` | Date | Default `Date.now` |

> Compound unique index on `{ user, course }` prevents duplicate enrollments.

### `Media`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Auto-generated. Used as the object key (via `.toString()`) for the storage provider |
| `uploadedBy` | ObjectId → User | Required, indexed |
| `mimeType` | String | Required |
| `size` | Number | Bytes, required |
| `status` | String | `UPLOADING` \| `PROCESSING` \| `READY` \| `FAILED` \| `COPY_PENDING`, default `UPLOADING` |
| `failedUploadLog` | String | Absolute path to `failed-upload.log` when status is `COPY_PENDING`, otherwise `null` |

| `type` | String | `VIDEO` \| `THUMBNAIL`, default `VIDEO` |
| `storageProvider` | String | `BACKBLAZE` \| `AWS_S3`, default `BACKBLAZE` |

> **`COPY_PENDING`**: MediaConvert succeeded and the HLS output was partially transferred to B2. Some files are still in S3 awaiting recovery. An admin can call `POST /media/:id/retry-transfer` to attempt recovery without rerunning MediaConvert.

### `OTP`
Stores short-lived OTPs for email verification and password resets (TTL-managed).

## Middleware

| Middleware | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `authenticate` | `middlewares/authenticate.js` | Validates signed `sid` cookie via Redis. Populates `req.user`. Rejects with `401` if missing or expired. |
| `optionalAuthenticate` | `middlewares/optionalAuthenticate.js` | Same as `authenticate` but does **not** reject unauthenticated requests. Used on routes that serve tiered responses (e.g. lesson list). |
| `authorize` | `middlewares/authorize.js` | Role guard. Rejects with `403` if `req.user.role` is not in the allowed roles list. |
| `checkLessonAccess` | `middlewares/lessonAccess.js` | LMS access control middleware. Enforces the Admin → Creator → Preview → Enrolled hierarchy. |
| `customRateLimit` | `middlewares/rateLimit.js` | Wraps `express-rate-limit`. Called as `customRateLimit(windowMinutes, maxRequests)`. |
| Error Handler | `app.js` (global) | Catches Mongoose validation errors, duplicate key errors (`11000`), operational errors (`isOperational`), and unknown errors. |
